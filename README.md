# mcq-mate

MCQ Mate is an mcq checker for Cambridge IGCSE and A-Level subjects that have an mcq (Multiple-Choice-Questions) paper.

## Current limitation

At the current version there is no support for the core papers, only the extended IGCSE and the A-Level papers are available. If you would like to see core papers, please let me know and we will try our best to add them

## This is a remake

This website is a remake of the original [Cambridge MCQ Checker](https://zieddev.github.io/cambridge-mcq-checker). It offers more features than the old version with modified appearance making it look more cleaner. The old version is still live though for those who loved it and still want to use it

## Why we made this website?

 this website was created to help all the IGCSE and A-Level students all over the world with their MCQ (Multiple-Choice-Questions) papers and make solving the paper more pleasing and simpler.
